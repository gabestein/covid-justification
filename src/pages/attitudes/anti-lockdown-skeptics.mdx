title: Anti-lockdown Skeptics
description: COVID is dangerous and some mitigation measures are necessary, but
  I can’t stay at home due to work and lockdowns are destroying the economy
layout: attitudes
arguments:
  - “I cannot afford to stop working and my employer insists that I go to work.
    I also need to use crowded public transportation everyday! What’s the point
    of closing bars and restaurants if I am going to be at risk anyway at work?”
  - “I know COVID is dangerous but I am alone, I belong to a high-risk group and
    I need to get my medication / food myself. What can I do? The lockdown has
    isolated me and I have no one to help me.”
  - “I am young and healthy. I do not belong to a high-risk group. Why do I have
    to go into a lockdown and get socially isolated?”
  - “I accept that COVID-19 is dangerous and we need to be very careful but
    isn’t the lockdown an extreme measure? How long can people handle such an
    isolation? What about the mental health repercussions?”
  - “I agree that COVID-19 is dangerous but what about the economic effects? By
    trying to protect high-risk groups we are condemning young and healthy
    people to poverty and even homelesness.”
  - “Governments have dealt with COVID in different ways. Why is that? Who is
    wrong and who is right?”
