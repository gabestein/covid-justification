title: Over Reactionists
description: COVID exists, but society has over-reacted to it and used it as an
  excuse to curtail civil liberties or serve private interests
layout: attitudes
arguments:
  - “Governments have dealt with COVID in different ways. Why is that? Who is
    wrong and who is right?”
  - “There is no scientific consensus”
  - “Our government is corrupt, it uses the pandemic just to make themselves and
    some other rich people even richer.”
  - '"COVID is not really deadly / it’s just a bad flu season / death rate is
    decreasing as pandemic goes on"'
  - “My government is putting us on a strict  lockdown, closing bars,
    restaurants, schools but a lot of people still have to go to work. They also
    have not invested enough in supporting the health system. If COVID-19 was
    that dangerous, wouldn’t they act with more urgency and protect everyone?”
  - “Certain restrictions may not be needed from the government or should be
    voluntary, especially given lockdown without compensation or forced work for
    a lot of people.”
  - “Scientific predictions and forecasts have failed before. Who says that they
    are right now?”
