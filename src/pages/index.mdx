This project (/section) explores the various attitudes towards COVID-19 and the related measures (lockdown, fines, etc.). Its goal is to identify the most important parameters that may affect people’s judgement in one way or the other, pushing them towards extreme attitudes regarding COVID-19 and thus creating large conflicts among groups. Our analysis is focused on good-will citizens who, for instance, are likely to object to vaccinations and other health measures due to misinformation and/or distorted beliefs - not ill-faith agents with specific motives. It is clear that there are millions of people who are skeptical or denying facts about COVID-19 in good-faith, so focusing our investigation on this group does not reduce its ecological validity. The goal is to create a nuanced categorization and understanding of groups that are differentially affected by and have various attitudes towards COVID-19 and to suggest appropriate interventions / policies.

Our analysis is based on two primary observations. First, it is crucial to differentiate the clear-cut denialism / conspiracies regarding COVID-19 from the objections to lockdown measures taken by governments to control the spread of COVID-19. Like in the case of climate change, there has been a concentrated effort to present society as divided into two large groups: one that accepts and conforms to whichever the ‘systemic’ narrative is (governments, big pharma & controlled scientific community) and another that rejects the government measures and scientific facts altogether in favor of an alternative interpretation of reality, often related to conspiracy theories. Similarly, in academia, we have been prone to easily dichotomize society into rational, objective thinkers and conspiracy theorists. However, this situation only leads to further divide and does not allow for any type of honest and fruitful communication. 

We suggest that there are large, healthy portions of the population that may reject government measures (lockdown, fines, etc.) as irrational and / or threatening our democratic rights and liberties. These people do not necessarily deny the facts about COVID-19, nor do they object to the necessity for health measures. 

The first goal of this project is to differentiate this group from the standard denialists and create a more nuanced categorization of public attitudes. This could be helpful both for scientists trying to create efficient policies and for the people themselves  in their self-categorization process. 

The second observation stems from the fact that, while we all live in the same COVID-19 era, we experience very different realities. Not everyone has access to the same information, different individuals have different needs, desires and obligations and governments have not dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic in the same way (both in terms of measures and communication). This means that, for many people, denying facts that are commonly accepted by the scientific community may not be just the result of irrationality. It might be the result of their objective life conditions, conflicting signals from governments and/or opposing opinions by scientists and it may serve as a coping mechanism to reduce the cognitive dissonance that comes from facing situations that are beyond their control. To give some examples, everyone’s social life has been limited to a fraction of what it used to be. However, especially for teenagers and young people, this is a disproportionately hurtful situation since socialization is their primary concern. Denying the severity or even the existence of COVID-19 may dissolve the cognitive dissonance that arises from the need to stay safe and the desire to meet friends and love partners. Similarly, the constant looming danger of a potentially deadly disease takes a huge toll on sensitive groups that struggle to strike a balance between protecting themselves from COVID-19 and avoiding depression. For example, someone who lives alone, with a pre-existing health condition and a limited budget, does not have many options. She would either have to isolate herself completely to avoid contracting COVID-19 or neglect the danger and go out to serve her everyday needs. Finally, millions of people have lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, have gone hungry, poor and / or homeless. Others are still being forced to go to work everyday in crowded buses or trains and spend 8+ hours in workplaces without any provision for their safety and health. For all these people, it is of paramount importance to continue to function, to retain their sanity and meet their everyday obligations. They are not able to change their actions because, to a large degree, these are dictated by the governments and their employers. Thus, once again, an adaptive reaction to avoid the stress that comes with cognitive dissonance may be to alter their beliefs about reality to make them conform to the actions they have to take. These examples illustrate the different types of audiences that exist and highlight our urgent responsibility as scientists to discard the unboundedly rational agent assumption (who does not even exist, anyway) and build theories and interventions that focus on actual human beings. 

In the first part, we discuss the various parameters that may push people to (more or less) justifiably adopt motivated beliefs about COVID-19. In the second part, we create a taxonomy of attitudes towards COVID-19 / lockdown measures, identify possible arguments by each group in support of its attitude and suggest a number of counter-arguments. The goal of these counter-arguments is to decrease unhealthy, antisocial and irresponsible behaviors that could prove dangerous to the actors and others. In the third part, we present the deliverables from the project and provide some possible recommendations that may be helpful (providing some sense of stability and coherence to the identified groups, deepening our understanding of the situation, reuniting the scientific community with society). In the Appendix, we include some draft material that could serve as primary material for flyers / videos / research.
