title: Lockdown Guidance Skeptics
description: COVID is dangerous and we need to act individually to combat it,
  but governments are not providing responsible guidance.
layout: attitudes
arguments:
  - “Governments are not acting rationally based on the latest science, and it’s
    putting me in danger; I can/have to come up with more effective measures by
    researching”
  - “Governments have dealt with COVID in different ways. Why is that? Who is
    wrong and who is right?”
